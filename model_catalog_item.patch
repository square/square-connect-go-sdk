 	// The item's description. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters, and its value length is of Unicode code points.  Deprecated at 2022-07-20, this field is planned to retire in 6 months. You should migrate to use `description_html` to set the description  of the [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem) instance.  The `description` and `description_html` field values are kept in sync. If you try to  set the both fields, the `description_html` text value overwrites the `description` value. Updates in one field are also reflected in the other,  except for when you use an early version before Square API 2022-07-20 and `description_html` is set to blank, setting the `description` value to null  does not nullify `description_html`.
