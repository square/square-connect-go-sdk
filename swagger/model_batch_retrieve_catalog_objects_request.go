type BatchRetrieveCatalogObjectsRequest struct {
	// The IDs of the CatalogObjects to be retrieved.
	ObjectIds []string `json:"object_ids"`
	// If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user. This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,  if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation, its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response.  Default value: `false`
	IncludeRelatedObjects bool `json:"include_related_objects,omitempty"`
	// The specific version of the catalog objects to be included in the response.  This allows you to retrieve historical versions of objects. The specified version value is matched against the [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject)s' `version` attribute. If not included, results will be from the current version of the catalog.
	CatalogVersion int64 `json:"catalog_version,omitempty"`
