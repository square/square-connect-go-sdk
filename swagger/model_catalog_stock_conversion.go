// Represents the rule of conversion between a stockable [CatalogItemVariation](entity:CatalogItemVariation) and a non-stockable sell-by or receive-by `CatalogItemVariation` that share the same underlying stock.
type CatalogStockConversion struct {
	// References to the stockable [CatalogItemVariation](entity:CatalogItemVariation) for this stock conversion. Selling, receiving or recounting the non-stockable `CatalogItemVariation`  defined with a stock conversion results in adjustments of this stockable `CatalogItemVariation`. This immutable field must reference a stockable `CatalogItemVariation` that shares the parent [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem) of the converted `CatalogItemVariation.`
	StockableItemVariationId string `json:"stockable_item_variation_id"`
	// The quantity of the stockable item variation (as identified by `stockable_item_variation_id`)  equivalent to the non-stockable item variation quantity (as specified in `nonstockable_quantity`)  as defined by this stock conversion.  It accepts a decimal number in a string format that can take up to 10 digits before the decimal point and up to 5 digits after the decimal point.
	StockableQuantity string `json:"stockable_quantity"`
	// The converted equivalent quantity of the non-stockable [CatalogItemVariation](entity:CatalogItemVariation)  in its measurement unit. The `stockable_quantity` value and this `nonstockable_quantity` value together define the conversion ratio between stockable item variation and the non-stockable item variation. It accepts a decimal number in a string format that can take up to 10 digits before the decimal point and up to 5 digits after the decimal point.
	NonstockableQuantity string `json:"nonstockable_quantity"`
