// Represents details about a `REFUND` [gift card activity type](entity:GiftCardActivityType).
type GiftCardActivityRefund struct {
	// The ID of the refunded `REDEEM` gift card activity. Square populates this field if the  `payment_id` in the corresponding [RefundPayment](api-endpoint:Refunds-RefundPayment) request  represents a redemption made by the same gift card.  Applications that use a custom payment processing system can use this field in a  [CreateGiftCardActivity](api-endpoint:GiftCardActivities-CreateGiftCardActivity)  request to link a refund with a `REDEEM` activity for the same gift card.
	RedeemActivityId string `json:"redeem_activity_id,omitempty"`
	AmountMoney      *Money `json:"amount_money,omitempty"`
	// A client-specified ID that associates the gift card activity with an entity in another system.   Applications that use a custom payment processing system can use this field to track information related to an order or payment.
	ReferenceId string `json:"reference_id,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the refunded payment. Square populates this field if the refund is for a  payment processed by Square. The payment source can be the same gift card or a cross-tender payment from a  credit card or a different gift card. Cross-tender payments can only be refunded from Square Point of Sale  or other Square products.
	PaymentId string `json:"payment_id,omitempty"`
