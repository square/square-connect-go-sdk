For payments under 10.00, in the Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States, tipping options are presented as no tip, .50, 1.00 or 2.00.  For payment amounts of 10.00 or greater, tipping options are presented as the following percentages: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%.  If set to true, the `tip_percentages` settings is ignored. Defaults to false.
