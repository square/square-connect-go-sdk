// Represents fraud risk information for the associated payment.  When you take a payment through Square's Payments API (using the `CreatePayment` endpoint), Square evaluates it and assigns a risk level to the payment. Sellers can use this information to determine the course of action (for example, provide the goods/services or refund the payment).
type RiskEvaluation struct {
	// The timestamp when payment risk was evaluated, in RFC 3339 format.
	CreatedAt string                   `json:"created_at,omitempty"`
	RiskLevel *RiskEvaluationRiskLevel `json:"risk_level,omitempty"`
