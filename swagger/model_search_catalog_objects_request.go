	// The pagination cursor returned in the previous response. Leave unset for an initial request. See [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/pagination) for more information.
	Cursor string `json:"cursor,omitempty"`
	// The desired set of object types to appear in the search results.  If not specified, the following catalog object types will be used as default: ITEM, CATEGORY, TAX, DISCOUNT, MODIFIER_LIST, DINING_OPTION, TAX_EXEMPTION, SERVICE_CHARGE, PRICING_RULE, PRODUCT_SET, TIME_PERIOD, MEASUREMENT_UNIT, SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN, ITEM_OPTION, CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION, QUICK_AMOUNT_SETTINGS.
	ObjectTypes []CatalogObjectType `json:"object_types,omitempty"`
	// If `true`, deleted objects will be included in the results. Deleted objects will have their `is_deleted` field set to `true`.
	IncludeDeletedObjects bool `json:"include_deleted_objects,omitempty"`
	// If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the requested object, as follows:  If a CatalogItem is returned in the object field of the response, its associated CatalogCategory, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and CatalogModifierList objects will be included in the `related_objects` field of the response.  If a CatalogItemVariation is returned in the object field of the response, its parent CatalogItem will be included in the `related_objects` field of the response.
	IncludeRelatedObjects bool `json:"include_related_objects,omitempty"`
	// Return objects modified after this [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), in RFC 3339 format, e.g., `2016-09-04T23:59:33.123Z`. The timestamp is exclusive - objects with a timestamp equal to `begin_time` will not be included in the response.
	BeginTime string        `json:"begin_time,omitempty"`
	Query     *CatalogQuery `json:"query,omitempty"`
	// A limit on the number of results to be returned in a single page. The limit is advisory - the implementation may return more or fewer results. If the supplied limit is negative, zero, or is higher than the maximum limit of 1,000, it will be ignored.
	Limit int32 `json:"limit,omitempty"`
