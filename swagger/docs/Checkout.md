**MerchantSupportEmail** | **string** | The email address to display on the Square Checkout confirmation page and confirmation email that the buyer can use to contact the merchant.  If this value is not set, the confirmation page and email will display the primary email address associated with the merchant&#x27;s Square account.

**PrePopulateBuyerEmail** | **string** | If provided, the buyer&#x27;s email is pre-populated on the checkout page as an editable text field.  Default: none; only exists if explicitly set. | [optional] [default to null]

For example, if the provided redirect_url is &#x60;http://www.example.com/order-complete&#x60;, a successful transaction redirects the customer to:  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId&#x3D;xxxxxx&amp;amp;orderId&#x3D;xxxxxx&amp;amp;referenceId&#x3D;xxxxxx&amp;amp;transactionId&#x3D;xxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;  If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow. | [optional] [default to null]
