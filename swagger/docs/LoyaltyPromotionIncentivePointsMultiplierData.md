**PointsMultiplier** | **int32** | The multiplier used to calculate the number of points earned each time the promotion is triggered. For example, suppose a purchase qualifies for 5 points from the base loyalty program. If the purchase also qualifies for a &#x60;POINTS_MULTIPLIER&#x60; promotion incentive with a &#x60;points_multiplier&#x60; of 3, the buyer earns a total of 15 points (5 program points x 3 promotion multiplier &#x3D; 15 points). | [default to null]
