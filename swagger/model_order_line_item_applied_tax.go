	// A unique ID that identifies the applied tax only within this order.
	Uid string `json:"uid,omitempty"`
	// The `uid` of the tax for which this applied tax represents. It must reference a tax present in the `order.taxes` field.  This field is immutable. To change which taxes apply to a line item, delete and add a new `OrderLineItemAppliedTax`.
	TaxUid       string `json:"tax_uid"`
