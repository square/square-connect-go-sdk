// Represents a snapshot of customer data. This object stores customer data that is displayed on the invoice  and that Square uses to deliver the invoice.  When you provide a customer ID for a draft invoice, Square retrieves the associated customer profile and populates  the remaining `InvoiceRecipient` fields. You cannot update these fields after the invoice is published.  Square updates the customer ID in response to a merge operation, but does not update other fields.
