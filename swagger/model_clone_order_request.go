// Defines the fields that are included in requests to the [CloneOrder](api-endpoint:Orders-CloneOrder) endpoint.
type CloneOrderRequest struct {
	// The ID of the order to clone.
	OrderId string `json:"order_id"`
	// An optional order version for concurrency protection.  If a version is provided, it must match the latest stored version of the order to clone.  If a version is not provided, the API clones the latest version.
	Version int32 `json:"version,omitempty"`
	// A value you specify that uniquely identifies this clone request.  If you are unsure whether a particular order was cloned successfully, you can reattempt the call with the same idempotency key without worrying about creating duplicate cloned orders. The originally cloned order is returned.  For more information, see [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency).
	IdempotencyKey string `json:"idempotency_key,omitempty"`
