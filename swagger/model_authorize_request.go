	// If `false`, the user must log in to their Square account to view the Permission Request form, even if they already have a valid user session. Default: `true`
	Session bool `json:"session,omitempty"`
	// __OPTIONAL__  When provided, `state` is passed along to the configured Redirect URL after the Permission Request form is submitted. You can include state and verify its value to help protect against cross-site request forgery.
