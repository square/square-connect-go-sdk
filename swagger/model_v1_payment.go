// A payment represents a paid transaction between a Square merchant and a customer. Payment details are usually available from Connect API endpoints within a few minutes after the transaction completes.  Each Payment object includes several fields that end in `_money`. These fields describe the various amounts of money that contribute to the payment total:  <ul> <li> Monetary values are <b>positive</b> if they represent an <em>increase</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g., <code>tax_money</code>, <code>tip_money</code>). </li> <li> Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an <em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g., <code>discount_money</code>, <code>refunded_money</code>). </li> </ul>
