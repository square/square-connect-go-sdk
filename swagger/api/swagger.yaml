        The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists

        settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement
        entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual
        adjustments, or chargeback holds.

        Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the
        [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)
        help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available
        from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.

        Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only
        whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in
        a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may
        take longer.

        Activates a domain for use with Apple Pay on the Web and Square. A validation
        is performed on this domain by Apple to ensure that it is properly set up as
        an Apple Pay enabled domain.

        This endpoint provides an easy way for platform developers to bulk activate
        Apple Pay on the Web with Square for merchants using their platform.

        Note: The SqPaymentForm library is deprecated as of May 13, 2021, and will only receive critical security updates until it is retired on October 31, 2022.
        You must migrate your payment form code to the Web Payments SDK to continue using your domain for Apple Pay. For more information on migrating to the Web Payments SDK, see [Migrate to the Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/migrate).

        To learn more about the Web Payments SDK and how to add Apple Pay, see [Take an Apple Pay Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/apple-pay).

        inserted/updated in an all-or-nothing manner. If an object within a batch is
        malformed in some way, or violates a database constraint, the entire batch
        containing that item will be disregarded. However, other batches in the same

        batches will be processed in order as long as the total object count for the
        request (items, variations, modifier lists, discounts, and taxes) is no more

          If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the
          requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field
          of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is
          helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user.
          This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,

          if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated
          CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and
          CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the
          response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation,

        Searches for [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject) of any type by matching supported search attribute values,
        excluding custom attribute values on items or item variations, against one or more of the specified query filters.

        This (`SearchCatalogObjects`) endpoint differs from the [SearchCatalogItems](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogItems)
        endpoint in the following aspects:

        - `SearchCatalogItems` can only search for items or item variations, whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` can search for any type of catalog objects.
        - `SearchCatalogItems` supports the custom attribute query filters to return items or item variations that contain custom attribute values, where `SearchCatalogObjects` does not.
        - `SearchCatalogItems` does not support the `include_deleted_objects` filter to search for deleted items or item variations, whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` does.
        - The both endpoints have different call conventions, including the query filter formats.

        Searches for catalog items or item variations by matching supported search attribute values, including
        custom attribute values, against one or more of the specified query filters.

        This (`SearchCatalogItems`) endpoint differs from the [SearchCatalogObjects](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects)
        endpoint in the following aspects:

        - `SearchCatalogItems` can only search for items or item variations, whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` can search for any type of catalog objects.
        - `SearchCatalogItems` supports the custom attribute query filters to return items or item variations that contain custom attribute values, where `SearchCatalogObjects` does not.
        - `SearchCatalogItems` does not support the `include_deleted_objects` filter to search for deleted items or item variations, whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` does.
        - The both endpoints use different call conventions, including the query filter formats.

        Use this endpoint to define a custom attribute that can be associated with customer profiles.

        A custom attribute definition specifies the `key`, `visibility`, `schema`, and other properties
        for a custom attribute. After the definition is created, you can call
        [UpsertCustomerCustomAttribute](api-endpoint:CustomerCustomAttributes-UpsertCustomerCustomAttribute) or
        [BulkUpsertCustomerCustomAttributes](api-endpoint:CustomerCustomAttributes-BulkUpsertCustomerCustomAttributes)
        to set the custom attribute for customer profiles in the seller's Customer Directory.

        Sellers can view all custom attributes in exported customer data, including those set to
        `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN`.

        Searches the customer profiles associated with a Square account using one or more supported query filters.

        Calling `SearchCustomers` without any explicit query filter returns all
        customer profiles ordered alphabetically based on `given_name` and
        `family_name`.

        Under normal operating conditions, newly created or updated customer profiles become available
        for the search operation in well under 30 seconds. Occasionally, propagation of the new or updated
        profiles can take closer to one minute or longer, especially during network incidents and outages.

        Returns a set of physical counts and inventory adjustments for the
        provided [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject) at the requested
        [Location](entity:Location)s.

        You can achieve the same result by calling [BatchRetrieveInventoryChanges](api-endpoint:Inventory-BatchRetrieveInventoryChanges)
        and having the `catalog_object_ids` list contain a single element of the `CatalogObject` ID.

        Results are paginated and sorted in descending order according to their
        `occurred_at` timestamp (newest first).

        There are no limits on how far back the caller can page. This endpoint can be
        used to display recent changes for a specific item. For more
        sophisticated queries, use a batch endpoint.

        shift with an `OPEN` status.
        - The `start_at` date is in the future.
        - The `start_at` or `end_at` date overlaps another shift for the same employee.
        - The `Break` instances are set in the request and a break `start_at`
        is before the `Shift.start_at`, a break `end_at` is after

        Creates a [location](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api).
        Creating new locations allows for separate configuration of receipt layouts, item prices,
        and sales reports. Developers can use locations to separate sales activity through applications
        that integrate with Square from sales activity elsewhere in a seller's account.
        Locations created programmatically with the Locations API last forever and
        are visible to the seller for their own management. Therefore, ensure that
        each location has a sensible and unique name.

      description: |-
        Adds points earned from a purchase to a [loyalty account](entity:LoyaltyAccount).

        - If you are using the Orders API to manage orders, provide the `order_id`. Square reads the order
        to compute the points earned from both the base loyalty program and an associated
        [loyalty promotion](entity:LoyaltyPromotion). For purchases that qualify for multiple accrual
        rules, Square computes points based on the accrual rule that grants the most points.
        For purchases that qualify for multiple promotions, Square computes points based on the most
        recently created promotion. A purchase must first qualify for program points to be eligible for promotion points.

        - If you are not using the Orders API to manage orders, provide `points` with the number of points to add.
        You must first perform a client-side computation of the points earned from the loyalty program and
        loyalty promotion. For spend-based and visit-based programs, you can call [CalculateLoyaltyPoints](api-endpoint:Loyalty-CalculateLoyaltyPoints)
        to compute the points earned from the base loyalty program. For information about computing points earned from a loyalty promotion, see
        [Calculating promotion points](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/loyalty-promotions#calculate-promotion-points).

      description: |-
        Calculates the number of points a buyer can earn from a purchase. Applications might call this endpoint
        to display the points to the buyer.

        - If you are using the Orders API to manage orders, provide the `order_id` and (optional) `loyalty_account_id`.
        Square reads the order to compute the points earned from the base loyalty program and an associated
        [loyalty promotion](entity:LoyaltyPromotion).

        - If you are not using the Orders API to manage orders, provide `transaction_amount_money` with the
        purchase amount. Square uses this amount to calculate the points earned from the base loyalty program,
        but not points earned from a loyalty promotion. For spend-based and visit-based programs, the `tax_mode`
        setting of the accrual rule indicates how taxes should be treated for loyalty points accrual.
        If the purchase qualifies for program points, call
        [ListLoyaltyPromotions](api-endpoint:Loyalty-ListLoyaltyPromotions) and perform a client-side computation
        to calculate whether the purchase also qualifies for promotion points. For more information, see
        [Calculating promotion points](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/loyalty-promotions#calculate-promotion-points).

        Search all orders for one or more locations. Orders include all sales,
        returns, and exchanges regardless of how or when they entered the Square
        ecosystem (such as Point of Sale, Invoices, and Connect APIs).

        `SearchOrders` requests need to specify which locations to search and define a
        [SearchOrdersQuery](entity:SearchOrdersQuery) object that controls
        how to sort or filter the results. Your `SearchOrdersQuery` can:

          Set filter criteria.
          Set the sort order.
          Determine whether to return results as complete `Order` objects or as
        [OrderEntry](entity:OrderEntry) objects.

        Note that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in
        offline mode might not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline
        orders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,
        not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

        - Reference the order by specifying the `order_id` when [creating the payment](api-endpoint:Payments-CreatePayment).
        Any approved payments that reference the same `order_id` not specified in the
        `payment_ids` is canceled.
        - Be approved with [delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/card-payments/delayed-capture).

      summary: CancelPaymentByIdempotencyKey
      description: |-
        Cancels (voids) a payment identified by the idempotency key that is specified in the
        request.

        Use this method when the status of a `CreatePayment` request is unknown (for example, after you send a
        `CreatePayment` request, a network error occurs and you do not get a response). In this case, you can
        direct Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same
        idempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After
        canceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.

        Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint
        returns successfully.

        the endpoint orders the result
        by location ID, and then by creation date within each location. If no locations are given

        You can also optionally specify `customer_ids` to search by customer.

        associated with the specified locations are returned.
        If the request specifies customer IDs, the endpoint orders results

        customer by subscription creation date.

          schedule to resend the requests at an increasingly slower rate. It is also a good practice to use a randomized delay (jitter) in your retry schedule.

          However, taking such a partial payment does not work if your request also includes

        A payment represents a paid transaction between a Square merchant and a
        customer. Payment details are usually available from Connect API endpoints
        within a few minutes after the transaction completes.

        Each Payment object includes several fields that end in `_money`. These fields
        describe the various amounts of money that contribute to the payment total:

        <ul>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>positive</b> if they represent an
        <em>increase</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>tax_money</code>, <code>tip_money</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an
        <em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>discount_money</code>, <code>refunded_money</code>).
        </li>
        </ul>

            If is_exchange is true, the tender represents the value of goods returned
            in an exchange not the actual money paid. The exchange value reduces the
            tender amounts needed to pay for items purchased in the exchange.
      description: |-
        A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
        exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
        amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

        Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
        as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
        field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

        Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

        The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
        in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
        the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

        *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
        merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
        associated payment.

        When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
        reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
        `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
        associated payment.

            `http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a successful transaction redirects
            the customer to:

            <pre><code>http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;orderId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx</code></pre>

            If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order
            confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that
            you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and
            finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow.

            A map (key-value pairs) of application-defined custom attribute values. The value of a key-value pair
            is a [CatalogCustomAttributeValue](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeValue) object. The key is the `key` attribute
            value defined in the associated [CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition](entity:CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition)
            object defined by the application making the request.

            If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
            defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
            the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
            `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`
            if the application making the request is different from the application defining the custom attribute definition.
            Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.

            Application-defined custom attributes are set at a global (location-independent) level.
            Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information about a catalog object
            or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom attributes
            to store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, card details, etc.).

        The wrapper object for the catalog entries of a given object type.

        Depending on the `type` attribute value, a `CatalogObject` instance assumes a type-specific data to yield the corresponding type of catalog object.

        For example, if `type=ITEM`, the `CatalogObject` instance must have the ITEM-specific data set on the `item_data` attribute. The resulting `CatalogObject` instance is also a `CatalogItem` instance.

        In general, if `type=<OBJECT_TYPE>`, the `CatalogObject` instance must have the `<OBJECT_TYPE>`-specific data set on the `<object_type>_data` attribute. The resulting `CatalogObject` instance is also a `Catalog<ObjectType>` instance.

        A query composed of one or more different types of filters to narrow the scope of targeted objects when calling the `SearchCatalogObjects` endpoint.

        Although a query can have multiple filters, only certain query types can be combined per call to [SearchCatalogObjects](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects).
        Any combination of the following types may be used together:
        - [exact_query](entity:CatalogQueryExact)
        - [prefix_query](entity:CatalogQueryPrefix)
        - [range_query](entity:CatalogQueryRange)
        - [sorted_attribute_query](entity:CatalogQuerySortedAttribute)
        - [text_query](entity:CatalogQueryText)
        All other query types cannot be combined with any others.

        When a query filter is based on an attribute, the attribute must be searchable.
        Searchable attributes are listed as follows, along their parent types that can be searched for with applicable query filters.

        * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
        - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `description`: `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `abbreviation`: `CatalogItem`
        - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
        - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`

        For example, to search for [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem) objects by searchable attributes, you can use
        the `"name"`, `"description"`, or `"abbreviation"` attribute in an applicable query filter.

            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this
            request among all your requests. A common way to create
            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique
            identifier (UUID).

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

            See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information.
        batches:
          type: array
          description: |-
            A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.
            The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs
            attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error
            in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.

            For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its
            `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.

            To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting
            with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of
            other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with
            ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to
            `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent
            CatalogItem.

            Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.

            Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request
            may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will
            be inserted or updated.

            If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the
            requested objects. Related objects are objects that are referenced by object ID by the objects
            in the response. This is helpful if the objects are being fetched for immediate display to a user.
            This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included.
            For example:

            If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated
            CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and
            CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the
            response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation,
            its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of
            the response.

            Default value: `false`

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
        `CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
        you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

            If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout displays an order
            confirmation page on your behalf; however, it is strongly recommended that
            you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and
            finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow.

            Default: none; only exists if explicitly set.

            cannot be more than 90% of the `total_money` calculated by Square for your order.
            The `location_id` must be a valid seller location where the checkout is occurring.
