        The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists
        the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most
        settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement
        entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual
        adjustments, or chargeback holds.

        Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the
        [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)
        help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available
        from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.

        Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only
        whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in
        a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may
        take longer.

        Creates or updates up to 10,000 target objects based on the provided
        list of objects. The target objects are grouped into batches and each batch is
        inserted/updated in an all-or-nothing manner. If an object within a batch is
        malformed in some way, or violates a database constraint, the entire batch
        containing that item will be disregarded. However, other batches in the same
        request may still succeed. Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects, and
        batches will be processed in order as long as the total object count for the
        request (items, variations, modifier lists, discounts, and taxes) is no more
        than 10,000.

        Returns a list of [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject)s that includes
        all objects of a set of desired types (for example, all [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem)
        and [CatalogTax](entity:CatalogTax) objects) in the catalog. The `types` parameter
        is specified as a comma-separated list of valid [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject) types:
        `ITEM`, `ITEM_VARIATION`, `MODIFIER`, `MODIFIER_LIST`, `CATEGORY`, `DISCOUNT`, `TAX`, `IMAGE`.

        __Important:__ ListCatalog does not return deleted catalog items. To retrieve
        deleted catalog items, use [SearchCatalogObjects](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects)
        and set the `include_deleted_objects` attribute value to `true`.

        Deletes a single [CatalogObject](entity:CatalogObject) based on the
        provided ID and returns the set of successfully deleted IDs in the response.
        Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the targeted object
        are also deleted. For example, deleting a [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem)
        will also delete all of its
        [CatalogItemVariation](entity:CatalogItemVariation) children.

        As a best practice, you should include the `version` field in the request to enable [optimistic concurrency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/optimistic-concurrency) control. The value must be set to the current version of the customer profile.

        To update a customer profile that was created by merging existing profiles, you must use the ID of the newly created profile.

        You cannot use this endpoint to change cards on file. To make changes, use the [Cards API](api:Cards) or [Gift Cards API](api:GiftCards).

        ecosystem (such as Point of Sale, Invoices, and Connect APIs).

        `SearchOrders` requests need to specify which locations to search and define a
        [SearchOrdersQuery](entity:SearchOrdersQuery) object that controls
        how to sort or filter the results. Your `SearchOrdersQuery` can:

          Set filter criteria.
          Set the sort order.
          Determine whether to return results as complete `Order` objects or as
        [OrderEntry](entity:OrderEntry) objects.

        Note that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in
        offline mode might not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline
        orders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,
        not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

        The total of the `payment_ids` listed in the request must be equal to the order

        array of `payment_ids` in the request.

        To be used with `PayOrder`, a payment must:

        - Reference the order by specifying the `order_id` when [creating the payment](api-endpoint:Payments-CreatePayment).
        Any approved payments that reference the same `order_id` not specified in the
        `payment_ids` is canceled.
        - Be approved with [delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#delayed-capture).
        Using a delayed capture payment with `PayOrder` completes the approved payment.

        Use this method when the status of a `CreatePayment` request is unknown (for example, after you send a
        `CreatePayment` request, a network error occurs and you do not get a response). In this case, you can
        direct Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same
        idempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After
        canceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.

        Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint
        returns successfully.

        When you take a payment through Square's Payments API (using the `CreatePayment`

        can use this information to determine the course of action (for example,
        provide the goods/services or refund the payment).

            Exact tipping options depend on the region in which the Square seller is active.

            For payments under 10.00, in the Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States, tipping options are presented as no tip, .50, 1.00 or 2.00.

            For payment amounts of 10.00 or greater, tipping options are presented as the following percentages: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%.

            If set to true, the `tip_percentages` settings is ignored.
            Defaults to false.

        A payment represents a paid transaction between a Square merchant and a
        customer. Payment details are usually available from Connect API endpoints
        within a few minutes after the transaction completes.

        Each Payment object includes several fields that end in `_money`. These fields
        describe the various amounts of money that contribute to the payment total:

        <ul>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>positive</b> if they represent an
        <em>increase</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>tax_money</code>, <code>tip_money</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an
        <em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>discount_money</code>, <code>refunded_money</code>).
        </li>
        </ul>

            tender amounts needed to pay for items purchased in the exchange.
      description: |-
        A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
        exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
        amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

        Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
        as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
        field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

        Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

        The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
        in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
        the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

        *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
        merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
        associated payment.

        When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
        reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
        `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
        associated payment.

            If `true`, Square Checkout will collect shipping information on your

            Square's `orderId`, `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL
            parameters. For example, if the provided redirect_url is
            `http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a successful transaction redirects
            the customer to:

            <pre><code>http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;orderId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx</code></pre>

            If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order
            confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that
            you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and
            finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow.

        A query composed of one or more different types of filters to narrow the scope of targeted objects when calling the `SearchCatalogObjects` endpoint.

        Although a query can have multiple filters, only certain query types can be combined per call to [SearchCatalogObjects](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects).
        Any combination of the following types may be used together:
        - [exact_query](entity:CatalogQueryExact)
        - [prefix_query](entity:CatalogQueryPrefix)
        - [range_query](entity:CatalogQueryRange)
        - [sorted_attribute_query](entity:CatalogQuerySortedAttribute)
        - [text_query](entity:CatalogQueryText)
        All other query types cannot be combined with any others.

        When a query filter is based on an attribute, the attribute must be searchable.
        Searchable attributes are listed as follows, along their parent types that can be searched for with applicable query filters.

        * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
        - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `description`: `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `abbreviation`: `CatalogItem`
        - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
        - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`

        For example, to search for [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem) objects by searchable attributes, you can use
        the `"name"`, `"description"`, or `"abbreviation"` attribute in an applicable query filter.

            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this
            request among all your requests. A common way to create
            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique
            identifier (UUID).

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

            See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information.
        batches:
          type: array
          description: |-
            A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.
            The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs
            attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error
            in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.

            For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its
            `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.

            To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting
            with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of
            other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with
            ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to
            `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent
            CatalogItem.

            Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.

            Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request
            may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will
            be inserted or updated.

            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this
            request among all your requests. A common way to create
            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique
            identifier (UUID).

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

        Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based
        on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,
        see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).
        This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,
        locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and
        sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the
        `Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.
        For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax
        based on the postal code, and some software is only available in
        certain states due to compliance reasons.

        For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the
        `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.
        These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have
        too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse
        these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.

        Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.
        These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,
        `administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,
        `first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.

        When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences
        (see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))
        are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale
        and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in
        communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,
        Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on.

            Identifies one or more loyalty reward tiers to apply during the order calculation.
            The discounts defined by the reward tiers are added to the order only to preview the
            effect of applying the specified rewards. The rewards do not correspond to actual
            redemptions; that is, no `reward`s are created. Therefore, the reward `id`s are
            random strings used only to reference the reward tier.

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
        `CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
        you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](entity:SearchOrdersSort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

            in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally
            identifiable information or card details).

            Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set
            `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed
            with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.

            Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.

            An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.

            Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same
