// Represents a filter used in a search for `TeamMember` objects. `AND` logic is applied between the individual fields, and `OR` logic is applied within list-based fields. For example, setting this filter value: ``` filter = (locations_ids = [\"A\", \"B\"], status = ACTIVE) ``` returns only active team members assigned to either location \"A\" or \"B\".
type SearchTeamMembersFilter struct {
	// When present, filters by team members assigned to the specified locations. When empty, includes team members assigned to any location.
	LocationIds []string          `json:"location_ids,omitempty"`
	Status      *TeamMemberStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
