// Represents a [CalculateLoyaltyPoints](api-endpoint:Loyalty-CalculateLoyaltyPoints) request.
type CalculateLoyaltyPointsRequest struct {
	// The [order](entity:Order) ID for which to calculate the points. Specify this field if your application uses the Orders API to process orders. Otherwise, specify the `transaction_amount_money`.
	OrderId                string `json:"order_id,omitempty"`
	TransactionAmountMoney *Money `json:"transaction_amount_money,omitempty"`
	// The ID of the target [loyalty account](entity:LoyaltyAccount). Optionally specify this field if your application uses the Orders API to process orders.  If specified, the `promotion_points` field in the response shows the number of points the buyer would earn from the purchase. In this case, Square uses the account ID to determine whether the promotion's `trigger_limit` (the maximum number of times that a buyer can trigger the promotion) has been reached. If not specified, the `promotion_points` field shows the number of points the purchase qualifies for regardless of the trigger limit.
	LoyaltyAccountId string `json:"loyalty_account_id,omitempty"`
}
