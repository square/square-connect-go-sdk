// An item variation, representing a product for sale, in the Catalog object model. Each [item](entity:CatalogItem) must have at least one  item variation and can have at most 250 item variations.   An item variation can be sellable, stockable, or both if it has a unit of measure for its count for the sold number of the variation, the stocked  number of the variation, or both. For example, when a variation representing wine is stocked and sold by the bottle, the variation is both  stockable and sellable. But when a variation of the wine is sold by the glass, the sold units cannot be used as a measure of the stocked units. This by-the-glass  variation is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the wine's inventory count at any time, the sellable count must be  converted to stockable count. Typically, the seller defines this unit conversion. For example, 1 bottle equals 5 glasses. The Square API exposes  the `stockable_conversion` property on the variation to specify the conversion. Thus, when two glasses of the wine are sold, the sellable count  decreases by 2, and the stockable count automatically decreases by 0.4 bottle according to the conversion.
type CatalogItemVariation struct {
	// The ID of the `CatalogItem` associated with this item variation.
	ItemId string `json:"item_id,omitempty"`
	// The item variation's name. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters, and its value length is of Unicode code points.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// The item variation's SKU, if any. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters.
	Sku string `json:"sku,omitempty"`
	// The universal product code (UPC) of the item variation, if any. This is a searchable attribute for use in applicable query filters.  The value of this attribute should be a number of 12-14 digits long.  This restriction is enforced on the Square Seller Dashboard, Square Point of Sale or Retail Point of Sale apps, where this attribute shows in the GTIN field. If a non-compliant UPC value is assigned to this attribute using the API, the value is not editable on the Seller Dashboard, Square Point of Sale or Retail Point of Sale apps unless it is updated to fit the expected format.
	Upc string `json:"upc,omitempty"`
	// The order in which this item variation should be displayed. This value is read-only. On writes, the ordinal for each item variation within a parent `CatalogItem` is set according to the item variations's position. On reads, the value is not guaranteed to be sequential or unique.
	Ordinal     int32               `json:"ordinal,omitempty"`
	PricingType *CatalogPricingType `json:"pricing_type,omitempty"`
	PriceMoney  *Money              `json:"price_money,omitempty"`
	// Per-location price and inventory overrides.
	LocationOverrides []ItemVariationLocationOverrides `json:"location_overrides,omitempty"`
	// If `true`, inventory tracking is active for the variation.
	TrackInventory     bool                `json:"track_inventory,omitempty"`
	InventoryAlertType *InventoryAlertType `json:"inventory_alert_type,omitempty"`
	// If the inventory quantity for the variation is less than or equal to this value and `inventory_alert_type` is `LOW_QUANTITY`, the variation displays an alert in the merchant dashboard.  This value is always an integer.
	InventoryAlertThreshold int64 `json:"inventory_alert_threshold,omitempty"`
	// Arbitrary user metadata to associate with the item variation. This attribute value length is of Unicode code points.
	UserData string `json:"user_data,omitempty"`
	// If the `CatalogItem` that owns this item variation is of type `APPOINTMENTS_SERVICE`, then this is the duration of the service in milliseconds. For example, a 30 minute appointment would have the value `1800000`, which is equal to 30 (minutes) * 60 (seconds per minute) * 1000 (milliseconds per second).
	ServiceDuration int64 `json:"service_duration,omitempty"`
	// If the `CatalogItem` that owns this item variation is of type `APPOINTMENTS_SERVICE`, a bool representing whether this service is available for booking.
	AvailableForBooking bool `json:"available_for_booking,omitempty"`
	// List of item option values associated with this item variation. Listed in the same order as the item options of the parent item.
	ItemOptionValues []CatalogItemOptionValueForItemVariation `json:"item_option_values,omitempty"`
	// A list of IFM channel ids and Square Online site ids where the object can be published.
	Channels []string `json:"channels,omitempty"`
	// ID of the ‘CatalogMeasurementUnit’ that is used to measure the quantity sold of this item variation. If left unset, the item will be sold in whole quantities.
	MeasurementUnitId string `json:"measurement_unit_id,omitempty"`
	// Whether this variation can be sold. The inventory count of a sellable variation indicates  the number of units available for sale. When a variation is both stockable and sellable,  its sellable inventory count can be smaller than or equal to its stockable count.
	Sellable bool `json:"sellable,omitempty"`
	// Whether stock is counted directly on this variation (TRUE) or only on its components (FALSE). When a variation is both stockable and sellable, the inventory count of a stockable variation keeps track of the number of units of this variation in stock and is not an indicator of the number of units of the variation that can be sold.
	Stockable bool `json:"stockable,omitempty"`
	// The IDs of images associated with this `CatalogItemVariation` instance. These images will be shown to customers in Square Online Store.
	ImageIds []string `json:"image_ids,omitempty"`
	// Tokens of employees that can perform the service represented by this variation. Only valid for variations of type `APPOINTMENTS_SERVICE`.
