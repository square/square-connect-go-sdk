	// The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically applies the `delay_action` to the payment.

This field is specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format.  Notes: This feature is only supported for card payments.

	// The read-only timestamp of when the `delay_action` is automatically applied, in RFC 3339 format.  Note that this field is calculated by summing the payment's `delay_duration` and `created_at` fields. The `created_at` field is generated by Square and might not exactly match the time on your local machine.
